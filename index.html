            <h2>Our Love Story</h2>
            <p>It all started on Dil Mil, where fate brought us together. A few coversations later, our love story started on March 12, 2024. Then we decided to meet on March 18th, our journey truly began.</p>
            <p>Our first date was in Longview, sharing laughter and stories over a meal at Chipotle. That day, we wandered through Longview Mall, not just exploring stores but also discovering more about each other. From that moment our story kept unfolding, filled with love, laughter, and countless memories.</p>
            <p>Though every little moment whether it's long conversations, shared dreams, or simple gestures of care, our love continues to grow stronger.</p>
